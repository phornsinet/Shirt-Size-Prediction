1. Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains 1,000 records with four columns: height (in centimeters), weight (in kilograms), an index column (Unnamed: 0), and T-shirt size labels (S, L, and XL). There were no missing values in the dataset, and basic descriptive statistics revealed that the average height was approximately 169.6 cm and average weight was 74.6 kg. A key observation was the imbalance in class distribution: out of 1,000 samples, 876 were labeled "XL", 68 as "S", and only 56 as "L". This imbalance needed to be considered during model evaluation to ensure smaller classes were not ignored.

2. Model Selection
Three classification models were selected to predict the T-shirt size from height and weight: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. These models were chosen due to their proven effectiveness in classification problems. Random Forest was included for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear data. SVM was selected for its power in separating classes with maximum margin, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Logistic Regression was used as a strong and interpretable baseline for comparison.

3. Methodology
Before model training, the data was preprocessed by standardizing the height and weight features using feature scaling. This step ensures that models like SVM and Logistic Regression perform better by treating all features equally. The dataset was then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Each model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. We also discussed common hyperparameters used in each model and explained how tuning these settings can improve performance.

4. Model Performance & Summary
Among the three models, Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 100%, correctly predicting all test instances. SVM performed very well too, with an accuracy of 98.5%, showing minor misclassifications in the minority classes. Logistic Regression followed with an accuracy of 95.5% but had noticeable difficulties with the smallest class ("L"), indicating it may not be the best choice for imbalanced datasets. Overall, Random Forest proved to be the most accurate and reliable model in this task, followed by SVM. This suggests that tree-based ensemble models are particularly effective when dealing with complex patterns in structured numeric data.
