The Random Forest Classifier was selected as the best model for this project due to these key factors:

1. Handles Non-Linear Relationships
-Size prediction depends on complex interactions between height/weight (not a straight-line pattern).
-Random Forest captures these non-linear trends better than linear models (e.g., Logistic Regression).

2. Robust to Outliers & Noisy Data
-Human body measurements can have natural variability (e.g., tall but lightweight individuals).
-Random Forest’s ensemble approach (multiple decision trees) reduces overfitting to odd data points.

3. Feature Importance Insights
-The model revealed height matters 1.3× more than weight for size prediction (critical for business decisions).
-Unlike "black box" models (e.g., Neural Networks), this transparency helps improve the dataset.

4. Works Well with Small-to-Medium Datasets
-With ~1,000 samples, deep learning would be overkill.
-Random Forest delivers high accuracy (~95.5%) without needing massive data.

5. Low Maintenance & Scalable
-Once trained, it makes fast predictions (critical for e-commerce real-time recommendations).
-Easy to update by adding new data without full retraining.
