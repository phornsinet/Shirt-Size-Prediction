1.Many people order clothes online, but often receive the wrong size because there is no accurate way to match their height and weight to the correct T-shirt size.
2.This leads to customer dissatisfaction, returns, and extra costs for sellers. Size charts are often confusing or not personalized, and people may not know which size fits best based on their body type. 
3.There is a need for a smarter, easier way to help people choose the right size before they order.
