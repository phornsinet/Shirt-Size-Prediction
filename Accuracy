Model Comparison Results
We trained and tested three machine learning models to predict T-shirt sizes (L, S, XL) based on height and weight:
| Model                  | Accuracy | Notes |
|------------------------|----------|-------|
| **Random Forest**      | **100%** | Perfect performance. No mistakes. |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | 98.5% | Only 3 predictions were wrong. Very good overall. |
| **Logistic Regression**| 95.5% | Some difficulty predicting rare sizes like "L". |

Performance Interpretation 
- Random Forest is the best model. It predicted all T-shirt sizes correctly. No errors.
- SVM did great too but made 3 small mistakes. Most errors were with size "L", which has fewer examples.
- Logistic Regression had more trouble, especially with size "L". Even though it worked well for the common size "XL", it made more errors for smaller classes.
 Note: The dataset has more XL sizes than L or S, so some models may favor predicting XL more often.

Evaluation Methodology
Here’s how we tested and compared the models:
1. Data Split
   - Total dataset: 1000 rows
   - Training set: 800 samples (80%)
   - Test set: 200 samples (20%)
2. Feature Scaling:
   - Height and weight were standardized (converted to a common scale).
3. Models Trained:
   - Random Forest
   - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
   - Logistic Regression
4. Evaluation Metrics Used:
   - Accuracy: How many predictions were correct.
   - Precision: How accurate the model is when it predicts a specific size.
   - Recall: How many actual sizes the model correctly found.
   - F1 Score: A balanced measure of precision and recall.
   - Confusion Matrix: A table showing what the model got right or wrong for each size.

Final Conclusion
- Use Random Forest — it’s the most accurate and reliable model in this project.
- It handles class imbalance well and gives perfect predictions on unseen data.
- Great for real-world use like recommending T-shirt sizes in online stores.
