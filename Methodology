1.Data Collection
-Used a dataset with height, weight, and T-shirt sizes (S, L, XL).
2.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
-Removed duplicates and outliers.
-Scaled height & weight for better model performance.
3.Exploratory Analysis (EDA)
-Checked size distribution (S, L, XL).
-Plotted height vs. weight to see patterns.
4.Model Training
-Tested Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
-Split data into 80% training, 20% testing.
5.Model Evaluation
-Compared accuracy, precision, recall.
-Selected the best-performing model.
6.Deployment
-Saved the model for future predictions.
-Created a script to predict sizes for new height & weight inputs.
